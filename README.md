## Deliverable: React Conversion (Phase 1)

This deliverable focused on converting the original static HTML/CSS website into a single-page application (SPA) using the React framework.

### What I Did
* **Initialized Project:** Set up a modern frontend development environment using Vite.
* **Component Conversion:** Converted all static HTML pages (`home.html`, `routes.html`, etc.) into reusable React components (`.jsx`).
* **Client-Side Routing:** Implemented `react-router-dom` to handle navigation between pages without requiring a full page reload. This creates a faster, smoother user experience.
* **Application Shell:** Created a main `App.jsx` component that serves as the primary layout, including a persistent header, navigation bar, and footer.
* **Deployment:** Configured and used a shell script (`deployReact.sh`) to automatically build the production version of the application and deploy it to the production server.

### Technologies Used
* React
* Vite
* React Router (`react-router-dom`)
* JavaScript (ES6)
* Bootstrap
* HTML5 / CSS3

### What I Learned
* I learned the fundamental difference between a traditional multi-page website and a single-page application (SPA). With the router, the page content changes dynamically instead of the browser requesting a new HTML file from the server for every click.
* I gained hands-on experience with the component-based architecture of React. Breaking the UI down into small, manageable pieces like `Home.jsx` and `About.jsx` makes the code much more organized.
* I spent a lot of time troubleshooting build errors related to file paths and `import`/`export` statements. This taught me how important details like case sensitivity and the `export` keyword are in a modern JavaScript project.

## Future Enhancements

* Add dynamic functionality and state management to make the forms and trackers interactive.
* Connect the frontend to a backend service to save and retrieve user data.
* Implement user login and authentication.

## ðŸš€ Startup React Phase 2: Interactivity

For this deliverable, I added reactivity to my existing React components.

- [x] **Multiple react components that implement or mock all app functionality (70 pts):**
    - I implemented a mock login system. The `Login` component now uses `useState` to capture form input and calls a function passed down from `App.jsx` to update the global authentication state.
    - I implemented mock data loading for the "Client Database." The `Client` component now uses `useEffect` to load a hard-coded array of client data into state, which is then rendered in a table. This mocks the functionality of fetching from a database.
    - The navigation bar in `App.jsx` is now reactive, conditionally rendering the "Routes" and "Client" links based on the `authState` variable.

- [x] **React useState and useEffect hooks (30 pts):**
    - **`useState`**: I used `useState` in `App.jsx` to "lift state up" and manage the global `userName` and `authState`. I also used `useState` in `login.jsx` to manage the local state of the form inputs.
    - **`useEffect`**: I used `useEffect` in `Client.jsx` with an empty dependency array (`[]`) to simulate a one-time data fetch when the component mounts, populating the `clients` state.
